    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        There are 3 reasons why this dish make us (o)mega happy: 1) tender salmon is 
        chock-full of healthy fats, 2) honey and mustard are a sweet and tangy match 
        made in heaven, and 3) cooking couscous in veggie stock enhances the flavor 
        without increasing the calories. Talk about a trifecta!

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Preparation</h4>
            <p>
                Wash and dry all produce. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Halve, peel, 
                and mince the shallot. Finely chop the parsley, making sure to keep the 
                leaves and stems separate. Trim the bottom inch of the asparagus and 
                discard. Cut the remaining asparagus in half widthwise. Then thinly slice 
                the bottom halves.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Making the couscous</h4>
            <p>
                Heat a drizzle of oil in a small pot over medium heat. Add the shallot. 
                Cook, tossing, for 1-2 minutes, until softened. Add the dry couscous and 
                toss another 1-2 minutes, until lightly toasted. Add 1Â¼ cups water and the 
                stock concentrate to the pot. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce to a simmer 
                for 10-15 minutes, until the liquid is absorbed and couscous is al dente. 
                Add the thinly sliced asparagus bottoms to the pot for the last 3-5 minutes 
                of cooking for extra flavor.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Making the glaze</h4>
            <p>
                Make the honey mustard glaze: In a small bowl, stir together the honey and 
                mustard. Season with salt and pepper.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Cooking the Salmon & Asparagus</h4>
            <p>
                Pat the salmon dry with a paper towel. Season on all sides with salt and pepper. 
                Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet. Spread each salmon fillet with most of 
                the glaze, reserving 1 Tablespoon for later. Toss the asparagus tops on the same 
                baking sheet with a drizzle of oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Roast 10-12 
                minutes, until the salmon is just cooked through and the asparagus is tender.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Finishing Touches</h4>
            <p>
                Stir the parsley stems into the couscous and fluff with a fork. Season with salt 
                and pepper. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and drizzle the salmon with the 
                reserved glaze.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Serve</h4>
            <p>
                Serve the honey mustard salmon on a bed of couscous pilaf alongside the roasted 
                asparagus. Sprinkle with the parsley leaves and enjoy!
