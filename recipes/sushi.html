    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish, prepared with vinegared rice, accompanied by
        a variety of ingedients, including seafood, usually raw, and vegetables. Styles of
        sushi, including its presentation, vary widely but the one key ingedient is "sushi
        rice."
    </p>
    <p>
        Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared 
        with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as 
        squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are 
        vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. 
        Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 sheets of sushi seaweed</li>
        <li>1 pound of prepared sushi rice</li>
        <li>1/2 pound raw salmon (or desired seafood of choice)</li>
        <li>4 ounces of cream cheese</li>
        <li>1 avocado, sliced</li>
        <li>soy sauce to taste</li>
        <li>pickled ginger to taste</li>
        <li>wasabi to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>First Layer</h4>
            <p>
                Place the seaweed on a flat, clean surface, eg. a cutting board. Then 
                cover the sheet of seaweed with an even layer of prepared sushi rice,
                flatten the rice gently with a rice paddle.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Cutting the raw fish</h4>
            <p>
                Make sure you're using a good, sharp knife. Cut straight down through the 
                filet, to make slices about half in inch wide. Then, cut those peices in 
                half through the center, so you have small strips of fish.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Second Layer</h4>
            <p>
                This is where you place your desired ingedients onto the rice, in the middle 
                of the layer of rice, leaving some room above and below to make a nice wrap. 
                For our ingredients, you place the salmon, the avocado, and the cream cheese.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Wrapping and Cutting</h4>
            <p>
                Roll the layers up tightly, using either parchment paper, plastic wrap, or 
                a bamboo mat. Then use a sharp knife to cut the sushi roll into pieces. No 
                need to use a serrated knife, just make sure it's sharp.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Serve</h4>
            Serve the cut pieces of sushi with soy sauce, pickled ginger, and wasabi as 
            desired.
        </li>
    </ol>
