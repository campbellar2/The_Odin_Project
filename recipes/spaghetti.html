    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A classic Italian/Italian-American pasta dish, consisting of spaghetti pasta, 
        tomato sauce, and meatballs. It was a popular dish among Italian immigrants 
        in New York City in the late 1800's/early 1900's. 
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound of spaghetti, thin spaghetti, or bucatini pasta</li>
        <li>1 pound of ground beef (16% fat or higher)</li>
        <li>1/2 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>3/4 cups of unseasoned breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of Parmesan-Romano cheese blend</li>
        <li>2 (28-ounce) cans of crushed tomatoes (San Marzano, if possible)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of tomato paste</li>
        <li>2-3 teaspoons of salt & pepper</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>about 1/2 cup of red wine</li>
        <li>3 cloves of chopped garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 copped yellow onion</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of chopped basil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of chopped parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Prepare the Sauce:</h4>
            <p>
                Heat half the olive oil in a large saucepan/pot on medium high heat. 
                Add onions, cook for 2 minutes. Add garlic, cook until fragrant 
                (about 30 seconds).
            </p>
            <p>
                Add tomato paste concentrate, stir to blend, and cook for 1 minute. Then
                add the canned tomatoes, and most of the basil and parsley, keeping some 
                for the meatballs. Stir the sauce until it starts to thicken, about 5 
                minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reduce heat to a simmer, stirring occasionaly while working on the next 
                steps.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Form the Meatballs:</h4>
            <p>
                In a large bowl, mix the beef, pork, basil, breadcrumbs, half the cheese, 
                and 2 teaspoons of salt and pepper. Don't over-mix, however, as that will
                make the meatballs too tough.
            </p>
            <p>
                Use a melon baller, or teaspoon, to form 1-inch round meatballs. Roll them 
                and compress into tight balls.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Brown the meatballs:</h4>
            <p>
                In a separate wide, shallow pan, heat remaining olive oil on medium high 
                heat. Brown the meatballs on all sides, about 2-3 minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may need to do it in two batches, depending on the size of your pan. 
                Don't overcrowd the pan, just cook them in a single layer. Don't overcook
                the meatballs either, they will continue to cook in the sauce. Just brown 
                the sides.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Finish and simmer the sauce:</h4>
            <p>
                Add the wine to the sauce and stir in the remaining cheese. Add salt to 
                taste. Add meatballs gently and stir slowly. Simmer the sauce and meatballs 
                on low heat for 30 - 45 minutes, stirring occasionaly.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Cook the pasta:</h4>
            <p>
                While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot with 4 quarts of salted water 
                in it to a boil (1 tablespoon of salt for every 2 quarts of water). When the 
                water returns to a boil add the pasta to the pot. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Leave the pot uncovered while you cook the pasta on high heat with a vigorous boil. 
                Put a timer on for 8 to 10 minutes, or according to package directions for al dente 
                pasta (cooked but still a little firm). Drain. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Serve:</h4>
            To serve, place thin layer of sauce on plate, add pasta, add sauce and meatballs, and 
            then sprinkle with grated Parmesan-Romano cheese. 
        </li>
    </ol>
